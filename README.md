# Craft Cognito Auth plugin

Enable authentication to Craft using [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/).

## Overview

This plugin enables requests to Craft to be securely authenticated in the presence of a **Cognito JWT** that can be successfully verified as matching a JWKS signature.

> JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.

This plugin asumes AWS Cognito is configured so that [users sign up and sign in with email instead of username](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html#user-pool-settings-aliases-settings-option-2) and that the App client being used has the sign-in API for server-based authentication (ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH) enabled as stated in the [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow.html?icmpid=docs_cognito_console#amazon-cognito-user-pools-server-side-authentication-flow)

## Usage

The plugin will attempt to verify any incoming requests with a JWT present in the `Authentication` header with a `Bearer` prefix, or with the simpler `X-Access-Token` header value. An example:

```shell
# With Authorization: Bearer
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.XbPfbIHMI6arZ3Y922BhjWgQzWXcXNrz0ogtVhfEd2o" MYCRAFTSITE.com

# With X-Access-Token
curl --header "X-Access-Token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.XbPfbIHMI6arZ3Y922BhjWgQzWXcXNrz0ogtVhfEd2o" MYCRAFTSITE.com
```

The plugin will attempt to verify the token using the [lcobucci/jwt](https://github.com/lcobucci/jwt) package for PHP. The package adheres to the [IANA specifications](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml) for JWTs.

If a provided token can be verified AND can be matched to a user account with a username matching the provided `sub` key, the user will be authenticated and the request allowed to continue.

If the token is verifiable but a matching user account does NOT exist, but the `Auto create user` setting is enabled AND public registration is enabled in the Craft settings, a new user account will be created on-the-fly and the new user then logged in.

This plugin provides example templates for you to use as a reference when building out your authentication solution. The example templates can by found in the [templates](templates/) folder.

## Deployment

1. Update version number in `composer.json`.
2. Add a new entry in `CHANGELOG.md` documenting the changes made.
3. Push a new tag matching the new version number with the following format: `vX.Y.Z`.
